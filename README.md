# basic-switch-configuration---physical-mode

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer lab focused on the **Physical Mode** of networking. The primary goal is to demonstrate the initial configuration of a network switch while considering the physical placement and cabling of the hardware.

## 📂 Repository Contents
* **Packet Tracer File**: `1.1.7-packet-tracer---basic-switch-configuration---physical-mode.pkt`
* **Configuration Goals**: Establishing basic switch security, management access, and port configuration within a physical wiring closet environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To view and interact with the lab:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **Cisco Packet Tracer** installed.
2. **Download**: Clone or download this repository.
3. **Run**: Open the `.pkt` file to begin the simulation in physical mode.

## 🛠 Skills Covered
* **Physical Cabling**: Connecting console and Ethernet cables in a rack environment.
* **Basic Switch Setup**: Configuring hostnames, passwords, and MOTD banners.
* **Management Interface**: Setting up the Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) for remote management.
* **Port Security**: Understanding physical access security.
